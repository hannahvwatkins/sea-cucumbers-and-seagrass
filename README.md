# Code and data for: Effects of sea cucumber fishing on tropical seagrass productivity
## Hannah V. Watkins, Rachel B. Munger, Isabelle M. Côté

If the entire repo is forked (or all files are downloaded together), you will be able to open the Code.Rproj file in the Code folder and run all analyses on a local computer without needing to set a working directory or changing filepaths in the code. Models are run with the [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) package, which is based on Stan and requires a C++ compiler to run. The Data folder contains all raw data for the project and the cleaned datasets generated by the data_processing.R file, as well as all the saved model outputs from the analyses.R file. The Code folder contains the scripts used to process, analyze, and create figures from the data, as well as a script with a custom plotting theme. All code is heavily annotated but please feel free to contact me at hannahvwatkins@gmail.com if you have any questions.
